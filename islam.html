The mosque includes extensive colored glass in its facade, and displays other traditional elements such as the Panj Kāse (five concaved) design. It is named in popular culture as the Pink Mosque, due to the usage of considerable pink color tiles for its interior design."
	,"Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is located in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and is considered to be the key site for worship in the country. The project was begun by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, with the purpose of creating a structure that would unite the cultural diversity, along with traditional and modern architecture. Construction of the largest mosque in the UAE began in 1996 to 2007."
	,"The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest, oldest and holiest mosques in the world. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque. In addition, the mosque holds a shrine which is said to contain the head of John the Baptist, who is honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims."
	,"The Shrine of Hazrat Ali, also known as the Blue Mosque, is located in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. Sunni Muslims believe that this is site of the tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib (the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad). However, Shia Muslims believe that the real grave of Ali is found within the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Iraq (next slide)."
	,"The Imām 'Alī Holy Shrine, also known as Masjid Ali,  in Najaf, Iraq, is considered the third holiest site Shia Muslims. Ali ibn Abi Talib, first Imam according to Shia belief, and the fourth caliph, according to Sunni belief is buried here."
	,"The famous historical Cordoba Mosque in Spain is regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture. Originally, it was a small temple of Christian Visigoth origin, a Catholic Basilica of Saint Vincent. When Muslims conquered Spain in 711, the church was divided into Muslim and Christian halves. This sharing arrangement of the site lasted until 784, when the Christian half was purchased by the Emir Abd al Rahman I, who then proceeded to demolish the original structure and build the grand mosque of Córdoba on its ground."
    ,"The Jameh Mosque is the grand, congregational mosque in Ishafan city, Iran. First being built in 771, Jameh Mosque is one of the oldest standing mosques in Iran. It has also been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2012."

It is considered the House of Allah and wherever they are in the world, Muslims are expected to face the Kabah when performing salat (prayer)."
    ,"This is the entry gate to the grave of Imam Husayn. The shrine is a holy place for Shia Muslims, as it is the mosque and burial site of  Imam Hussain ibn Ali, the third Imam of Shia Islam, in the city of Karbala, Iraq. Every year, millions of pilgrims visit the city to observe Ashura, which marks the anniversary of Imam Husayn ibn Ali's death."

Repetitive chanting of OM in accordance with the Vedic methods, generates mystic powers that leads one to concentrate, meditate, and finally get into a state of higher consciousness. The primordial sound OM is produced by combining the sounds of the letters A, U, and M. OM is also called the four element syllable, where the letters A,U,M are three elements, and the silence that follows the chanting to be the fourth element. The sound produced by the letter A represents the wakeful state, the letter U, the dream state, and M, the deep sleep state. Thus, OM represents the complete experiences of all the worlds, and the cosmic Brahman (ultimate reality).

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">A temple is the home of God where devotees and the Divine commune. The vibration from the mantras (hymns) that are chanted, the prayers, and other rituals performed in the main hall all result in an environment that is vibrant with divine energy. As such, learned scholars advise devotees to look and feel their best when going to a temple so that they can experience the maximum benefit. It is best to bathe before and wear nice, modest, and clean clothing which would be suitable for sitting on the floor of the temple or prostrating in front of deities.  It is common to see devotees washing their hands or feet before entering the temple, and shoes/slippers must be left outside at designated places. Inside the temple, a lot of devotees may bring fruit, flowers, milk, and other food items. While inside, it is important to maintain an atmosphere of silence, and only speak in soft tones when necessary. In essence, the temple environment gives devotees an opportunity to concentrate and perhaps even experience the Divine with Bhakti (devotion).</div>

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">The Varna system, or the caste system, is addressed as a positive factor in the Scriptures. The Varna system encourages division of labor within the society for efficient functioning, based on the natural tendencies of a person. In the Scriptures (the Bhagavad Gita) one’s Varna is determined by one’s own qualities, and not based on one’s birth into a family. Also, it should be addressed that the varna system as it is in the scriptures is a linear (not hierarchical) system. At the basic level, the 4 different Varna’s are Brahmin (thinkers who lead followers on a righteous path), Kshatriya (leaders or warriors), Vaishya (business and finance oriented people), and Sudras (unskilled workers). Most Hindus are strongly encouraged to educate and fight against the caste system as it is practiced today.

Hence, Hindus bow down to the light which represents Knowledge and which is deemed to be the greatest of all forms of wealth. The traditional lamp has further significance. The oil represents desires, and the wick represents ego. When lit by spiritual knowledge, the desires (oil) gets slowly exhausted and ultimately even the wick (ego) burns out. The flame of the lamp is always burning upward, further symbolizing that one should always seeks higher ideals.

They observe the fast by not eating at all, eating less, eating fruits, or just simple food (it varys from person to person and depends on the occasion of the fasting). Fasting is also called Upavaasa, with the word Upa meaning “being near” and Vaasa meaning “to stay.” Through the fasting process, Hindus stay near the Lord and contemplate on him instead of spending time on elaborate preparations of food. Fasting also helps to cultivate the ability to have self control, to have control over one’s senses, and to guide the mind to be peaceful. Obviously, it is unwise (and not recommended) to fast to the extent that one becomes weak or irritable.

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">The custom of not stepping on educational tools is a frequent reminder of the high position of Knowledge in Hindu culture.
